# Road-Accident-Analysis-
The Aim of this project is to create a Power BI dashboard that will provide information on UK traffic accident data.
Data on car accidents over a two-year period were reviewed for this reason. While the "Year on Year Growth of Casualties" measure calculated the percentage change, the "Current Year To Date Casualties" and "Previous Year Casualties" measures recorded the total number of casualties. 
In a similar vein, the "Year on Year Growth of Accidents," "Previous Year Accidents Count," and "Current Year Accidents Count" measures were used to evaluate accident numbers.
A strategic decision-making tool for enhanced safety measures, these insights provide an overview of the trends in road safety.
